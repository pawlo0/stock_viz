                <p>The site can have any number of pages as long as there is a clear purpose for each one. It must have the following features.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages/ functions and to locate relevant information</li>
                    <li>Consistent style across the pages through the use of CSS</li>
                    <li>Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window</li>
                    <li>Use of Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Clearly stated purpose for each page</li>
                    <li>Clear landing page (this might just be a special page that introduces the site, or some instructions)</li>
                    <li>It should use data from a different source (i.e. not the music data), visualise it in at least on three ways not covered in the example (using viz.js), and be interactive in some way</li>
                </ol>
